	<div id="INTRO"><h2>Intro</h2></div>
	Are you in need of a website to tell the world what you do? Do you want a game to play for free? Do you want to learn a new hobby? You should try using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a website. Imagine a website with links, scroll bars and anything you want. You can do that with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML, CSS and JavaScript may look and sound complicated but with a little bit of practice you are on your way to make a great website.<br><br>
In this book you will learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We will explore the world of binary and protocols. Binary codes are series of 1s and 0s. Protocols are series of operations. Finally you will learn the basics of servers and routers, the computers that send and store information.<br><br>
<br>
<br><div id="C1">
<h2>Chapter 1 : What You Need To Get Started</h2></div>
	Welcome to the amazing world of computer programing. This chapter will teach you all you need to get started. You may think you need a lot of things but actually all you need is a computer with internet connection, a code editor and a web browser. <br><br>
The code editor is an app that lets you edit code, and normally has syntax highlighting and auto completion to help you write code. Syntax highlighting is where different functions or operations have different colors. It makes errors red or orange. Auto completion completes words based on what you have typed. The code editor is where you will spend most of the time while making a website.<br><br>
The web browser is where you can view your website. A little secret is that in a web browser you can open the developer tools where  you can debug your code.<br><br>
<br><br>
<div id="C2"><h2>Chapter 2 : The Three Coding Languages You Need</h2></div>
	The only three coding languages you need to know are H.T.M.L , C.S.S. and JavaScript. H.T.M.L stands for HyperText Markup Language and is for the text and pictures of the website. For example, If you wanted to add a paragraph to your website you would use H.T.M.L. C.S.S stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is for styling the website. For example, If you wanted to change the font of text you would use C.S.S. Javascript is for the interactions. For example, If you wanted to add a clickable button to your website you would use JavaScript. <br><br>
	HTML is a markup language meaning that it’s only used for the body or the text of your website and not for styling or interaction with the website. HTML5, the newest version, is the only version that does not need a flash player. Other HTML versions (HTML4,XHTML,ect ) use flash player. The flash player is not supported on most mobile devices.<br><br>
	CSS is a styling language as it is in its name. It is only used for making your website look pretty as the plain default grayscale look of the HTML is not very pleasing. The newest version of CSS is CSS3.<br><br>
	JavaScript is the most complicated language among the three because it’s used to create the main interactions on your website. For example, you can use JavaScript to make online multiplayer games.<br>
<br><br>

<div id="C3"><h2>Chapter 3  What is HTTPS?</h2></div><br>
	HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a secure version of HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It transfers code from the computer that has the code to the other computers’ browsers.<br>
A browser is the app you use to view websites. For example Google Chrome is a popular browser and Safari is another one. Protocols are series of commands that computers use to communicate. For example IP(Internet Protocol) is the protocol that allows computer to communicate on the internet. <br>
    <br><br>
<div id="C4"><h2>Chapter 4  What Does The Server Do?</h2></div><br>
A server is a computer or a series of computers that store the code to make a website. When you look at a website your computer asks the server for the code, then your computer runs the code and displays the result. Depending on the size of the code you may need more storage. If the storage needed is too much for one computer you may need more computers, but for a small website you will only need your own computer acting as a server.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div id="C5"><h2>Chapter 5  What Do Routers Do?</h2></div><br>
		Now that you understand what a server is, you need to know how the server sends information to your computer, so that you can see the website. This is done by computers called routers that send information from place to place. To send something the server first divides the image or text into small packets. Then each of the packets gets a address that it needs to get to. When a router sees a packet it tells the packet which router to go to next. When all the packets get to the destination computer's browser, the browser checks if all of them have arrived safely. If one packet is missing the server sends the packet again.
<br>
<br>
<div id="C6"><h2>Chapter 6  IP Addresses</h2></div><br>
	 In this chapter you will learn about IP Address.  IP stands for Internet Protocol. An IP Address is an address for a computer. To send a package to someone you have to know his/her address, same with computers and IP Addresses. An IP Address is like a phone number and consists of numbers meaning the region code and other things. There are two types of addresses IPV4 and IPV6.  IPV4 has 4 bytes. IPV6 has 16 bytes. A byte is eight bits and a bit is a 1 or 0.
<br><br>
<div id="C7"><h2>Chapter 7  How The Computer Gets To A Website</h2></div> 	<br>
When a computer wants to view a website, it asks URL for the IP Address. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. URL tells the computer what the IP Address is based on the name of the website you are trying to get to. Then the routers send the code to your website in little pieces. When the pieces arrive, if some pieces are missing, the server sends those ones again. When all of them arrive,the computer that is receiving them runs the code and displays the result.<br>
<br><br>
<div id="C8"><h2>Chapter 8  What To Do Next</h2></div><br>
	Now that you have learned how websites work and how servers send information around through routers, to finally make a website, you need to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After you learn those three languages, you can make your first website. Once you have made your first website, you can learn more about the three languages and experiment. Mistakes are amazing, so don't worry if somethings starts going wrong when you change the code. All great programmers make mistakes sometimes, so don’t worry.<br>
